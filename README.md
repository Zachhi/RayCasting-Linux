# Ray Casting

Simple ray casting simulation that shows how rays of light would behave depending on its source location and the walls around it

## Demo

## Controls

* Click twice to draw a wall from the first click to the second click
* "C" to clear all walls
* Move mouse around to change light source position
* "Space" to change the source type. 
      3 Types:
      Draw all the light rays 
      Draw only the light rays that hit walls
      Draw no light rays
* "Up arrow" to increase amount of light rays
* "Down arrow" to decrease amount of light rays
* "Escape" to exit the program

### Dependencies

SFML (Simple and Fast Multi-Media Library) 2.5.1 or later is required in order to run this program. You can install SFML here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

### Installing

* Download the code from github, or clone the repository
* link SFML with the project depending on what enviroment you are using
* I used Visual Studio...a simple 5 minute tutorial for linking SFML with a Visual Studio project can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfMQyOw1zik

### Executing program

* Once everything is installed and set up, simply compile the .cpp and .h files and run "main.cpp"
